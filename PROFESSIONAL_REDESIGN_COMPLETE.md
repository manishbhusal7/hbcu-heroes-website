# ✅ PROFESSIONAL WEBSITE REDESIGN - COMPLETE!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### **Problem 1: Unprofessional Duplicate Donation Sections**
❌ **Before:** Two separate donation cards (Individual + Business) on same page  
✅ **After:** ONE simple, clean donation section for individuals only

### **Problem 2: Partner Toolkit Visible on Homepage**
❌ **Before:** Partner toolkit form was displayed directly on homepage  
✅ **After:** Partner toolkit is accessed ONLY through contact form (dropdown option)

### **Problem 3: Confusing Navigation**
❌ **Before:** "Donate as Individual" and "Donate as Partner" both on hero  
✅ **After:** "Donate Now" and "Become a Partner" - clear separation
